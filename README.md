# Tkinter Learning Project
Series of Python scripts written using Tkinter, that mimics the Windows operating system.
I used this project as a way to learn the basics of Python, so the app has no real practical use.

Features:
An Installer that creates system files or checks if they already exist.
On the Desktop you can create, name and delete a few different types of files and folders.
A Start Menu, where you can crate shortcuts for said files and folders.
Two apps that can be launched from the Start Menu - Settings and File Explorer.
A Debug menu that allows you to toggle fullscreen mode, hide the taskbar, enable visible borders
for the tiles on the Desktop and wipe all files and folders from the Desktop.

The project was way more ambitious when I started it, but since I fulfilled my goal of 
learning the basics of Python (and learned almost everything about Tkinter in the process),
I decided to leave the project as it currently is and move on to something else.
I'm still satisfied with the way it turned out, as what is there works pretty well.

To install it copy the .py files from the WIndows9 directory to any folder and run the installer script.
